## Why Home Miner Manager?

Mining profitably at home requires more than just hardware—it requires intelligence. Home Miner Manager automatically optimizes when and what you mine based on real-time energy prices and coin profitability.

### 🎯 The Price Band Strategy

**Mine the right coin at the right time:**
- ⚡ **Fully Configurable Bands** - 6 price bands, each fully customizable (coin + modes)
- 💰 **Dynamic Coin Switching** - Auto-switch between OFF/DGB/BC2/BCH/BTC/BTC_POOLED
- 🎛️ **Per-Band Modes** - Configure eco/standard/turbo/oc for each price tier
- 🔄 **Hysteresis Prevention** - Look-ahead logic prevents rapid oscillation between bands
- 🏆 **Champion Mode** - NEW: During expensive periods, only the most efficient miner runs
- 📊 **Band Analytics** - Track band transitions, time in each band, and profitability
- 🏠 **Provider Plugins** - Works with plugin-based energy providers, with automatic price updates
- 💡 **Example Strategy**: OFF above 20p → DGB eco 12-20p → DGB std 7-12p → BCH OC 4-7p → BTC OC below 4p

### 🏆 Champion Mode (NEW)

**Maximize efficiency during expensive electricity:**
- 📊 **Efficiency Ranking** - Calculates W/TH (watts per terahash) for all miners
- 👑 **Champion Selection** - Most efficient miner runs in lowest mode during Band 5 (20-30p/kWh)
- 🔌 **Home Assistant Integration** - Automatically turns OFF all other miners
- 🔄 **Auto-Promotion** - If champion fails, next best miner takes over
- 📈 **Profitability** - Keep mining during expensive periods with minimal energy waste
- 🔔 **Notifications** - Get alerts when champion is selected or promoted

### ⚡ Intelligent Energy Management

**Stop wasting money on expensive electricity:**
- 🔋 **Real-time Pricing** - Half-hourly Octopus Agile tariff integration
- 📈 **24-Hour Forecast** - See upcoming prices with visual sparkline charts
- 💰 **Automatic Optimization** - Mine during cheap slots, idle during expensive ones
- ⚙️ **Manual Override** - Force enable/disable independent of price bands
- 📊 **Cost Tracking** - Total energy consumption with per-miner breakdowns
- 💡 **Typical Result**: 20-40% reduction in electricity costs vs always-on mining

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Runs on anything—Raspberry Pi, spare laptop, NAS, or dedicated server.**

### PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danvic-dev/hmm-local.git
cd hmm-local
docker-compose up -d
```

The compose file includes both PostgreSQL and the HMM container. Access at `http://localhost:8080`

> **💡 Platform Updates:** docker-compose includes `hmm-local-updater` companion service that safely handles platform updates via the Settings → Platform Updates page. The updater ensures zero-downtime updates by managing container recreation.

### SQLite (Development/Fallback)

HMM automatically falls back to SQLite if PostgreSQL is unavailable. Perfect for quick testing or resource-constrained environments.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./config:/config \
  -e WEB_PORT=8080 \
  ghcr.io/danvic-dev/hmm-local:main
```

### CI/CD Build Targets

GitHub Actions builds images independently by component:

- `hmm-local` builds only when main app paths change (`app/**`, `ui-react/**`, root runtime files).
- `hmm-local-updater` builds only when `updater/**` changes.

This behavior applies to branch, PR, and tag workflows in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`, so unrelated commits do not rebuild other images.

## 🎯 Price Band Strategy Setup

The Price Band Strategy is the core intelligence of the platform. Here's how to configure it:

### Understanding Bands

The strategy uses **6 fully customizable bands**, each defining:
- **Price Range** - Min/max energy price in pence per kWh
- **Target Coin** - OFF, DGB, BC2, BCH, BTC, or BTC_POOLED (fully customizable)
- **Miner Modes** - eco/standard/turbo/oc per miner type (fully customizable)

### Default Band Configuration

Out of the box, **all 6 bands default to OFF** with `managed_externally` modes. This allows you to configure your own strategy:

| Band | Price Range | Default Coin | Default Modes | Suggested Use |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | ≤0p | OFF | managed_externally | Negative pricing (rare) |
| 2 | 0-5p | OFF | managed_externally | Very cheap - customize for max mining |
| 3 | 5-10p | OFF | managed_externally | Cheap - good for standard mining |
| 4 | 10-20p | OFF | managed_externally | Moderate - eco modes recommended |
| 5 | 20-30p | OFF | managed_externally | Expensive - champion mode ideal |
| 6 | 30p+ | OFF | managed_externally | Very expensive - stay off |

**Champion Mode:** Can be enabled on any band (commonly Band 5: 20-30p):
- Calculates W/TH efficiency for all miners from last 6 hours
- Selects the most efficient miner as champion
- Champion runs in lowest mode (eco/low)
- All other miners turn OFF via Home Assistant
- Auto-promotes next best miner if champion fails 3 times

**All coins and modes are fully customizable per band.**

### Customizing Bands

1. Navigate to **Strategy → Band Configuration**
2. Click dropdown for coin or mode in any band
3. Select new value
4. Changes save automatically and apply at next 30-minute boundary
5. Monitor transitions in **Strategy → Audit Log**

![Band Configuration Editor](screenshots/band-config.png)

### Strategy Behavior

**Automatic Execution:**
- Runs every 1 minute via APScheduler
- Evaluates current energy price
- Determines target band
- Applies hysteresis (look-ahead confirmation)
- Switches coin and modes if needed
- Handles champion mode selection/promotion
- Logs transition with reason

**Champion Mode Logic:**
When Band 5 active AND champion mode enabled:
1. Query last 6 hours of telemetry for all enabled miners
2. Calculate average W/TH efficiency: `avg_power / (avg_hashrate_th * 1000)`
3. Sort miners by efficiency (lower = better)
4. Select most efficient as champion
5. Champion runs in lowest mode (eco/low)
6. All others turned OFF via Home Assistant `switch.miner_{name}`
7. Champion stays until band exit
8. If champion fails 3 consecutive times, promote next best
9. Send notification on promotion

**Hysteresis Logic:**
When upgrading to a cheaper band, the system checks if the *next* 30-minute slot also qualifies. This prevents rapid switching if a single cheap slot is followed by expensive slots.

**Manual Override:**
- **Enable Strategy** - Force enable regardless of price
- **Disable Strategy** - Force disable regardless of price  
- Override state persists until manually changed or strategy re-enabled

**Reconciliation:**
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Checks if HA device states match database
- Sends corrective commands if drift detected
- Ensures system stays in sync

### Monitoring Strategy Performance

- **Current Band** - Operations page shows active band number and coin
- **Champion Status** - Purple badge shows current champion miner
- **Band Transitions** - Audit log tracks every band change with timestamp and reason
- **Time in Band** - Analytics show duration in each band over time
- **Profitability** - Track earnings per band to optimize configuration

## 🏊 Pool Management

### Supported Pools

**Solo Mining Pools:**
- **Solopool** - BCH, DGB, BTC solo mining with statistics API
- **Braiins Pool** - Bitcoin FPPS mining with detailed stats

**Public Pools:**
- Any stratum pool compatible with cgminer

### Adding a Pool

  "port": 3014,
  "wallet": "your_dgb_address",
  "password": "x",
  "coin": "DGB"
}
```

### Pool Health Monitoring

The platform monitors:
- ✅ Connection status (active/inactive)
- 📊 Share acceptance rate
- ⏱️ Last share timestamp
- 🎯 Best share found
- 💰 Balance (for solo pools with API)

### Pool Analytics

**Solopool Integration:**
- Workers online count with sparkline charts

### Database Migrations

Migrations run automatically on startup. To add a new migration:

```python
# In app/core/migrations.py

# Migration XX: Description (Date)
async with engine.begin() as conn:
    try:
        await conn.execute(text("""
            ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bar VARCHAR(100)
        """))
        print("✓ Added bar column to foo")
        core_migrations_ran = True  # If core model changed
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"⚠ Migration XX skipped: {e}")
```

**PostgreSQL Compatibility:**
- Use `BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` not `DEFAULT 0`
- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
- Test both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Core model changes require container restart

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run test suite
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_price_band_strategy.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **CRITICAL**: Follow agent behavior rules in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
4. Test changes thoroughly (both PostgreSQL and SQLite)
5. Build React UI (`cd ui-react && npm run build`)
6. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. Open Pull Request

**Development Guidelines:**
- Always search existing code before adding new functionality
- Never make changes without understanding the full context
- Implement automatic recovery mechanisms for all failures
- Write clear, modular Python with type hints
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Test migrations on both database types

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start After Update

**Problem:** Container starts but shows 500 errors

**Solution:** Core model migration completed, restart required:
```bash
docker-compose restart
# or
docker restart HMM-Local
```

Look for this in logs:
```
================================================================================
⚠️  CORE MODEL MIGRATIONS COMPLETED
⚠️  Container restart required for schema changes to take effect
================================================================================
```

### Champion Mode Not Working

**Problem:** Champion mode enabled but all miners still running

**Solutions:**
- Verify price is in Band 5 range (check Operations page)
- Check Home Assistant integration enabled in config.yaml
- Verify HA switch entities exist: `switch.miner_{name_lowercase}`
- Check logs for "Champion selection" or "HA device control" errors
- Ensure miners have telemetry data (last 6 hours required)

### Database Migration Errors

**Problem:** PostgreSQL migration fails with syntax errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL connection
docker exec hmm-pg psql -U hmm -d hmm -c '\dt'

# View migration logs
docker logs HMM-Local 2>&1 | grep -E '(Migration|✓|⚠)'

# Verify schema
docker exec hmm-pg psql -U hmm -d hmm -c '\d agile_strategy'

# Manual migration if needed (advanced)
docker exec -i hmm-pg psql -U hmm -d hmm <<EOF
ALTER TABLE agile_strategy ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS champion_mode_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE agile_strategy ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS current_champion_miner_id INTEGER;
EOF
```

### Miner Not Discovered

**Problem:** Auto-discovery doesn't find miners

**Solutions:**
- Verify miner is on same network
- Check IP range includes miner's address
- Ensure firewall allows discovery
- Try manual addition with known IP

### Strategy Not Executing

**Problem:** Price Band Strategy not switching coins/modes

**Solutions:**
- Check strategy is enabled: Strategy → Status
- Verify region is set: Energy → Pricing
- Check current price is within configured bands
- Review audit log for error messages: Strategy → Audit

### High Reject Rate

**Problem:** Pool shows high reject rate (>5%)

**Solutions:**
- Check network latency to pool
- Try different pool server (geographic proximity)
- Verify miner difficulty setting
- Check for network congestion

### Temperature Warnings

**Problem:** Miner temperature exceeds safe limits

**Solutions:**
- Improve airflow around miner
- Lower overclock settings
- Use lower power mode in strategy bands
- Clean dust from heatsinks/fans

### Energy Prices Not Updating

**Problem:** Agile prices showing stale data

**Solutions:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify region is correct: Energy → Pricing
- Manually trigger update: Energy → Update Now
- Check logs for API errors: docker logs v0-miner-controller

### Docker Container Won't Start

**Problem:** Container fails to start or crashes

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker logs HMM-Local

# Check PostgreSQL
docker logs hmm-pg

# Restart PostgreSQL first
docker restart hmm-pg
sleep 5
docker restart HMM-Local

# Rebuild container
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :8080
```

### Database Errors

**Problem:** SQLite/PostgreSQL errors or corruption

**Solutions:**

**PostgreSQL:**
```bash
# Backup database
docker exec hmm-pg pg_dump -U hmm hmm > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Restore
docker exec -i hmm-pg psql -U hmm hmm < backup_20260202.sql

# Reset (WARNING: loses data)
docker-compose down -v  # Removes volumes
docker-compose up -d
```

**SQLite:**
```bash
# Backup
cp config/data.db config/data.db.backup

# Reset (WARNING: loses data)
rm config/data.db
docker-compose restart
```
